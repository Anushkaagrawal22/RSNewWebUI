- how to re-compile when adding new API functions:
	* delete jsonapi_generator/src/*inl and call make again from RS root.

- test RS API with curl:

    $ curl --verbose -u cyril:proutprout233 -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:9092/rsPeers/GetRetroshareInvite
   
        * Trying 127.0.0.1...

TODO
====
   [X] create a standalone working mithril example not talking to RS
   [X] modify it so that it prints some information that is from RS
   [ ] create a login page that asks for login+passwd to be used in the JSonAPI requests. The page should test the validity
			of the passwd by requesting some authenticated info and then switch to normal webUI when authentication is a success.
   [ ] modify the css style to get something nice
